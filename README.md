## Getting Started

### Running The React App
- Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- In the project directory, you can run: `npm start`
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
- Runs the app in the development mode.

### Running The Tests
- In the project directory, you can run: `npm test`
- Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### Building For Production 
- In the project directory, you can run: `npm run build`
- Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. 
- The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
